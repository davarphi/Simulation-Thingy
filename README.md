This is a simplification of Touhou or a bullet hell game in general.

To use, just do the following:
1. Install `uv`
2. In the main file, run `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. TO run the game, run `uv run main.py`

Or if you only to use regular ol' `pip`, you can do so
1. Make sure you have `pip`
2. Activate the virtual environment by running `.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `python run main.py` as usual
